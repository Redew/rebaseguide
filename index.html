<h1>how to rebase/squash</h1>

<p>Hi. Rebasing really sucks. This is a guide to make it less sucky.</p>

<h2>generating ssh keys</h2>

<p>First, you need to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">generate an SSH key</a> (this will open up in a new page). Click the link to do that, then check back here.</p>

<p>Now, go to the repo that you want to rebase at. You want to go to YOUR FORK. If you go to the main file (i.e. Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown instead of YOUR-FORK/Pokemon-Showdown), it will not direct you to the correct files. Navigate to the bar on the right. It will look like this:</p>

<p>Click on SSH, then click on the clipboard (or c/p it manually) and go to your terminal. The link will look like this:<br /> <span class="cd">git@github.com:Redew/Pokemon-Showdown.git</div></p>

<h2>using the terminal</h2>

<p>Next, type in everything <strong>after</strong> the <em>$:</em></p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
user@Computer-Name:~$ git clone REPOSITORY LINK
</pre>
</div>

<p>After you do that, navigate to it through <span class="cd">cd</span>. Example:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
user@Computer-Name:~$ cd Pokemon-Showdown
</pre>
</div>

<p>Next, you tell it you want to rebase. Type in everything after the $:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
user@Computer-Name:~/Pokemon-Showdown$ git rebase -i HEAD~NUMBER
</pre>
</div>

<p>The commits you want to rebase will be a number. Let's say you edited a file 3 times without it being merged. So, you would type in: git rebase -i HEAD~3. You will get something like this:</p>

<p>The order of commits from top to bottom goes oldest to newest, respectively.</p>

<p>Let's say we wanted to put the newest two commits into the top (oldest) commit. We can do this by navigating with the arrow buttons and replacing pick with squash:</p>

<p>After you've squashed what you want to, ctrl + x to exit. Press Y to save changes. When it asks you to rename, just click enter and continue with the default path. After that, type in:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
user@Computer-Name:~/Pokemon-Showdown$ git push --force
</pre>
</div>

<p>You will get a weird spiel about git push, but at the bottom, you should see something like this:</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
Counting objects: 1, done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 240 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:REPOLINK/PATH
+ d152d96...afa5b8e master -> master (forced update)
</pre>
</div>

<h2>finish</h2>

<p>Done! Everything should be squashed.</p>
